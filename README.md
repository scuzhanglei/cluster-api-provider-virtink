# Kubernetes Cluster API Provider Kubrid

[![build](https://github.com/smartxworks/cluster-api-provider-kubrid/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/smartxworks/cluster-api-provider-kubrid/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Kubernetes-native declarative infrastructure for [Kubrid](https://github.com/smartxworks/kubrid).

## What is the Cluster API Provider Kubrid

The [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management. Cluster API Provider Kubrid is a concrete implementation of Cluster API for Kubrid.

The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true Kubrid hybrid deployments of Kubernetes. It is built atop the lessons learned from previous cluster managers such as [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) and [kubicorn](http://kubicorn.io/).
